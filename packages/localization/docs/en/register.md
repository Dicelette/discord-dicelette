The bot allows you to configure a model ("server model") which then allows you to create character sheets as well as retain dice.

The data remains entirely on your server, and the model is designed to be infinitely adaptable (or almost!).

You will find [here](<https://dicelette.github.io/en/docs/sheet/model>) all the information to configure the model and save the forms, in order to be able to use the commands </dbd:{{- 
dbd}}>, </dbroll:{{-dbroll}}>, </graph:{{-graph}}> or </calc:{{-calc}}>.
