			:game_die: **Dice Roller** :game_die:
			-> Find the *bot* on [GitHub](<https://github.com/Lisandra-dev/dice-thread>)

			## Usage
			- </roll:${rollId}> : Roll a dice
			- </scene:${sceneId}> : Create a new scene thread for future rolls, it will also archive all previous scene threads if they starts with "ðŸŽ²".
			 You can also create "time bubble" with settings \`/scene bubble:True\`. By default, it will use the date as thread name.

			You can use the bot directly dice in a message (**without using a slash commands**), using :
			- Direct: \`dice\`, like \`d6\` or \`2d6\`
			- Undirect : \`my message content [dice]\`, like \`*Phibi jump on Wumpus and inflict [2d6] damage*\`.
			- Semi-direct : \`1d100 my message content\`, like \`1d100 Phibi jump on Wumpus and inflict damage\`.

			## Dice notation
			[See the documentation for dice notation](<https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/dice.html>).

			The bot supports also:
			- [Dice group](<https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/group-rolls.html>)
			- [Modifiers](<https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/modifiers.html>)
			- [Comments](<https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/roll-descriptions.html>)
			- [Mathematics](<https://dice-roller.github.io/documentation/guide/notation/maths.html>)
			- And also "bulk rolls" (roll multiple dice in same time) using the syntax: \`[dice number]#[dice]\`, for example \`2#d6\` to throw 2 6-sided dice.

		help: `
		- The type of die must be a valid type (it will be tested when you save the model).
		- The value must be a number and can be optional. If you remove it, the die will be compared to the statistic rather than a value.
		- The total must be a number and can be optional. If you remove it, the total will be automatically calculated when the user is saved.
		- The formula allows editing the combined value with the die. Use \`$\` to symbolize the value (e.g., \`+$\`, \`-$\`, \`($-10)/2\`...).
		- A statistic can be a combination of other statistics, such as \`strength+endurance\`. If the \`combination\` value is defined, then the \`min\` and \`max\` parameters will be disabled. Additionally, users will not have to enter the value manually. Finally, this value will be excluded from the calculation of the total allocated points.
		- You can also register a skill dice. This will be used for the skill command from database. Also, user can have their own skill dice.
		
		Note that the file provided here is just an example and should be customized before being saved.

		It is possible to save only skill dice, or nothing at all, if you wish to use only skill dice commands.
